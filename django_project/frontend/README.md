# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project structure

We use [containers/component archicture](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.4rmjqneiw).

- `public/`: Contains static files such as the index.html file, favicon, and manifest.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
    - `assets/`: Stores images and global styles.
    - `components/`: Contains reusable, presentational components, such as Header, Footer, and App.
    - `containers/`: Includes container components, which are responsible for handling the application's state and logic, such as MainPage.
    - `utils/`: Contains utility files, such as an api.js file for making API calls.
    - `index.js`: The main entry point of the application, where the React app is rendered to the DOM.
    - `index.css`: Contains global CSS styles.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
