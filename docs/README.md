## Building the Kartoza Handbook as a PDF

### Check out the code

You need both the Kartoza Handbook repo and the mkdocs pdf building repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kartoza/sawps.git
```

### Install Dependencies (non direnv and venv way)

You need to install these packages:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-with-pdf
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mdx_gh_links
pip install mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin
```

### Install Dependencies (venv way)

Initial setup

```bash
virtualenv --python=python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Subsequent sessions:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
When you are done with your session, deactivate your venv:

```bash
deactivate
```

### Using direnv (more preferred way)

Initial setup done once:

1. Install direnv with your package manager
2. Make sure it is set up in your bashrc 
```
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
3. Enter this git directory in your shell
4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After this, whenever you enter the directory, direnv will load your direnv and penv for you. See .envrc for details on how it is configured.


### Build the documentation

> Note that whenever you add new sections to nav in the mkdocs.yml
> (used for building the web version), you should apply those same
> edits to mkdocs-pdf.yml if you want those new sections to appear
> in the pdf too.

```bash
cd  docs
./build-docs-pdf.sh
xdg-open TheKartozaHandbook.pdf
```

If you are in VSCode, you can also just run the 'Compile PDF' task. The
generated PDF will be placed in docs/pdfs/.
