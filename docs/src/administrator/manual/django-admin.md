# Django Admin Page Documentation

The Django Admin is the central hub to create, read, update, or delete SAWPS data. Only users with staff status (i.e. administrators) can enter the administration page.

## Heading to Django Admin

![Django Admin](./img/admin-1.png)

1. Click on the profile icon, then click **Django Admin**.

## Django Admin Layout

The Welcome page will be the first thing that administrators see. It typically displays a welcome message and provides an overview of the available actions and options within the administration panel.

In the top right corner of the administration panel, administrators will find a section that usually displays their username. In this section, administrators have the following options:

1. **Welcome**: Displays welcome with the administrator's name.

2. **View Site**: Clicking on this option will take administrators to the `SAWPS` website.

3. **Change Password**: Clicking on this option allows administrators to change their administration password. Administrators will be prompted to provide their current password and then set a new one.

    ![Change Password](./img/admin-8.png)
