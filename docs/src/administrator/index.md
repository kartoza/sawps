# For Administrators

This is the homepage for all administrator related documentation.

The content is divided into two sections:

* The [administrator guide](guide/index.md), which describes common workflows for system administrators in a tutorial format.
* The [administrator manual](manual/index.md), which describes each page of the admin user interface and what the various options on that page do.
