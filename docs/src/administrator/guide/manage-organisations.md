# Managing Organisations

This documentation guides administrators through managing organisations on the SAWPS platform. Management of organisations includes (but is not limited to) adding/removing members from organisations, managing organisation data, and managing notifications/reminders for the organisation.

## Where to Manage Organisations?

After you have logged into the administration site, scroll down on the landing page until you see 1️⃣ the **STAKEHOLDER** section. In this section you will see 2️⃣ the four links to the various pages required to manage organisations.

![Managing Organisations 1](./img/manage-organisations-1.png)

## Organisation Representatives

If you clicked on the `Organisation representative` link on the landing page, you will be redirected to a page that has 1️⃣ a list of the platform's organisation representatives and their respective organisations. The organisation representatives are the managers of their respective organisations and can manage their organisation.

![Organisation Representatives 1](./img/organisation-representatives-1.png)

### Searching for Representative(s)

If you do not see the representative you would like to see in the list due to the length of the list, you can utilise the `Search` functionality. To do so, click on 1️⃣ the `Search` field and type a few characters (i.e. letters in the representative's name), and then click on 2️⃣ the `Search` button to filter the list of representatives.

![Organisation Representatives 2](./img/organisation-representatives-2.png)

If the representative you are looking for is still not there, then you will need to follow the steps below to add them.

### Adding Organisation Representative(s)

If you would like to add another registered user as an organisation representative, you can click on 1️⃣ the `ADD ORGANISATION REPRESENTATIVE` button.

![Organisation Representatives 3](./img/organisation-representatives-3.png)

When you click on the `ADD ORGANISATION REPRESENTATIVE` button, you will be redirected to the `Add Organisation representative` page. You can then click on 1️⃣ the `Organisation` dropdown menu, you will be shown a list of all the current organisations on the platform and you should choose your desired organisation. Having specified an organisation, you can then click on 2️⃣ the `User` dropdown menu and select the registered user that you would like to be an organisation manager.

![Organisation Representatives 4](./img/organisation-representatives-4.png)

**Note:** If the organisation or user is not available in the dropdown menus, then you should follow either the [add organisation](#alternative-way-to-add-organisations) or [add user](#alternative-way-to-add-users) instructions.

Once you have chosen an organisation and a user you have three options to proceed forward:

![Organisation Representatives 5](./img/organisation-representatives-5.png)

- `Save and add another`: Which will allow you to save the current organisation manager and move forward with adding a new one.
