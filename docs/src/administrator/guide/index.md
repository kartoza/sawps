# Administrator Guide

Welcome to the SAWPS administrator guide. In this section of the documentation, we aim to show administrators common workflows for managing the platform effectively. Here is a brief overview of the content provided here:

* **[Accessing the Administration Site:](./access-admin-site.md)** This section contains a quick description on how administrators can access the administration site of the SAWPS platform.
* **[Managing Organisations:](./manage-organisations.md)** This section describes how administrators can manage organisations (i.e. members, data, reminders, etc ) on the SAWPS platform.
* **[Managing Users:](./manage-users.md)** This section describes how administrators can manage users ( i.e. their associated organisations, their permissions, etc.) on the SAWPS platform.
* **[Managing Taxa:](./manage-taxa.md)** This section describes how administrators can manage taxa ( i.e. add, remove, modify, etc.) on the SAWPS platform.
* **[Managing Uploaded Data:](./manage-upload-data.md)** This section describes how administrators can manage uploaded data ( e.g. properties, their permissions, etc.) on the SAWPS platform.
* **[Managing Lookup Tables:](./manage-lookup-tables.md)** This section describes how administrators can manage the values in the look-up tables (i.e. add/edit/delete the options available in dropdown menus using the pencil icons) on the backend so these values are reflected in the front-end and backend dropdown menus.

> **Disclaimer:** The workflows described in the guide demonstrate the necessary workflows for an administrator. If there is a page on the administration site that you would like to edit but has not been described in the guide, please do not edit it until you have been in contact with the development team.
