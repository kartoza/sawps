# System architecture
In this section, we outline the system architecture using ER Diagrams, Software Component Diagrams etc. and key libraries / frameworks used in this project.

## Frameworks used

The following is a list, with brief descriptions, of the key components used in creating this platform. Please refer to their individual documentation for in-depth technical information.
