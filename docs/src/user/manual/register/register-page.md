# Registration Page Documentation

The Registration Page is a critical component of the platform, allowing users to create their accounts and gain access to the system. This page provides a straightforward and secure registration form for new users to sign up. It collects essential user information, including first name, last name, email address, password, and confirmation of the password.

## Registration Form

The Registration Form is designed to gather the necessary information for creating a user account.
