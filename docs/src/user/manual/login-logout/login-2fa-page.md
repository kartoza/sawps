# Two-Factor Authentication Page Documentation

The Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Page is a critical security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to the users account. With 2FA, the user will be required to enter a OTP (One-Time Password) code in addition to the users regular login credentials. This documentation provides an explanation of the 2FA page.

1. **OTP Code**: In the centre of the page, the user will find the OTP (One Time Pin) Code field. This is where the user must enter the one-time password generated by the users authentication app (Google Authenticator).

2. **Authenticate Button**: Once the user have entered the OTP code, click the `Authenticate` button to verify the users identity. If the OTP code is correct, the user will gain access to the users account.

3. **Lost Your Device?**: Below the `Authenticate` button, the user will see a section titled `Lost your device?`.This section provides guidance for users who have lost access to their 2FA device.

Typically, this involves contacting the users account administrator, or support, for further assistance.
