# Two-Factor Authentication Page Documentation

The Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Page is a critical security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to the user's account. With 2FA, the user will be required to enter a OTP (One-Time Password) code in addition to their regular login credentials. This documentation provides an explanation of the 2FA page.

1. **OTP Code**: In the centre of the page, the user will find the OTP (One Time Pin) Code field. This is where the user must enter the one-time password generated by their authentication app (Google Authenticator).

2. **Authenticate Button**: Once the user has entered the OTP code, they can click the `Authenticate` button to verify their identity. If the OTP code is correct, the user will gain access to their account.

3. **Lost Your Device?**: Below the `Authenticate` button, the user will see a section titled `Lost your device?`.This section provides guidance for users who have lost access to their 2FA device. If the user no longer has access to their authentication app, they can follow the instructions provided here to regain access to their account. Typically, this involves contacting the user's account administrator, or support, for further assistance.

## Two-Factor Authentication Security

## Summary
Users can effectively use the 2FA page to enhance the security of their account and maintain control, even in the event of a lost device.
