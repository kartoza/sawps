# Two-Factor Authentication Page Documentation

The Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Page is a critical security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to the user's account. With 2FA, the user will be required to enter an OTP (One-Time Password) code in addition to their regular login credentials. This documentation explains the 2FA page.

1. **OTP Code**: In the centre of the page, the user will find the OTP (One Time Pin) Code field. This is where the user must enter the one-time password generated by their authentication app (Google Authenticator).

2. **Authenticate Button**: Once the user has entered the OTP code, they can click the `Authenticate` button to verify their identity. If the OTP code is correct, the user will gain access to their account.

3. **Contact**:  The `Contact` link provides access to the [contact page](../help-contact.md) where the SAWPS team is ready to assist with any inquiries or issues.

## Two-Factor Authentication Security

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a critical security measure that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised access to the user's account. It is highly recommended to enable and use 2FA to protect a user's data and ensure the integrity of their account.

## Summary
Users can effectively use the 2FA page to enhance the security of their accounts and maintain control, even in the event of a lost device.
