# Map Functionalities Documentation

> **Disclaimer:** The images on the map depict property locations represented as points. It's important to note that the map displays the location of the data on the map itself unless you are a data consumer. Some of the images in the manual may vary slightly from what you see on the platform due to continuous updates to the platform. On the platform you will see `green question mark` ![Help Desk Icon 1](./img/help-icon.png) buttons in the top right corner (underneath the `LOGOUT` button), you can click on these to access the help desk.

This documentation outlines the functionalities available in the map view, including features that allow the user to interact with and customise the map display for their needs.

### Map

1. **Map**: The `Map` tab.

2. **Question Mark Icon**: Click on the `Question Mark Icon` to learn valuable insights into optimising the use of the Map page. Explore the helpful tips and guidelines provided in this sidebar to enhance the efficiency in navigating and utilising the map features. Click on the `visit our Documentation` link to visit the documentation.

3. **Points**: Upon landing on the page, users are greeted with a visual representation of property locations in the form of points, providing an immediate overview of the geographical distribution of properties (unless the user is designated as a data consumer).

4. **Zooming In Icon**: The zooming-in icon is represented by a plus sign (+). Click on this icon to zoom in on the map, making features and details appear larger and more visible.

5. **Zooming Out Icon**: The zooming-out icon is represented by a minus sign (-). Click on this icon to zoom out on the map, reducing the size of the displayed area and providing a broader view.

6.  **3D Icon**: The `3D Icon` serves as a visual guide within the map view, enhancing the user's ability to explore a 3D representation of the environment. Represented by a 3D symbol, this icon provides users with a quick reference to the cardinal directions, facilitating orientation while navigating the 3D map. The Compass Icon dynamically adjusts its orientation based on the user's movements, consistently pointing toward Geographic North. Users can interact with the icon to reset the map orientation to its default north-facing position.

    - **Species Population Choropleth Map on Provincial Level**: When a user selects a species, the map automatically changes to a choropleth map showing the population of the species for the year, displaying it on a provincial level.

    - **Zooming In to Property Level**: As the user zooms in, the choropleth map changes to a property level, providing more detailed insights into the population distribution.

    - **Switch Between 3D and 2D View**: Users can seamlessly switch between 3D and 2D views, enhancing their exploration experience.

7. **Toggle Between Dark and Light Mode**: The map view offers the option to toggle between dark and light modes, enhancing the viewing experience based on the user's preference.

    **Dark Mode**

    ![Dark Mode](./img/map-2.png)

    * **Dark Mode (Moon Icon):** Click on the moon icon to switch to dark mode, which provides a darker color scheme suitable for low-light or night-time viewing.

    **Light Mode**

    ![Light Mode](./img/map-3.png)

    * **Light Mode (Sun Icon):** Click on the sun icon to switch to light mode, offering a brighter color scheme for daytime or well-lit environments.

8. **Printing Out the Current Map Preview**: The print icon allows the user to generate a physical or digital copy of the current map preview. When clicked, this icon initiates the printing process, enabling the user to obtain a hard copy or a digital image of the map for reference or sharing.

### Choropleth Maps

- **Species Population Range Indicator**: The chart uses a gradient of colors to smoothly represent the varying population densities. Users can quickly assess the concentration of species in different regions based on the color intensity. Users can use this chart to analyse and interpret the population distribution of selected species across different geographical areas, distinguishing between low, moderate, and high population densities.

    ![Population Range](./img/map-5.png)

- **Highlighting The Most Populated Region**: The map dynamically identifies and highlights the region with the population density for the selected species. This region is visually emphasised to draw the user's attention to the area with the most significant concentration of the chosen species.
