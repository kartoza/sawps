# Layers

Welcome to the documentation for map layers available in the application. This document provides an overview of the map layers, how to access them, and how to interact with and customise their appearance.

> DISCLAIMER: Some of the images in the manual may vary slightly from what you see on the platform due to continuous updates to the platform. On the platform you will see `green question mark` ![Help Desk Icon 1](./img/help-icon.png) buttons in the top right corner (underneath the `LOGOUT` button), you can click on these to access the help desk.
The user can view the layer description by hovering over the layer.

**Layers**

![Layers](./img/layers-1.png)

## Summary
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the map layers available in our application. These layers serve as essential tools for exploring South Africa's geography and ecological data. From rivers and roads to critical biodiversity areas, each layer offers unique insights into the region's natural and infrastructural features. Users can select and display multiple layers simultaneously, facilitating in-depth research and analysis. By leveraging these map layers, researchers, conservationists, environmentalists, and geospatial analysts can better understand and protect South Africa's diverse landscapes and ecosystems.
