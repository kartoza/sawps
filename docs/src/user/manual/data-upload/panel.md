## Step 1

The Data Table Page serves as the central hub for viewing and interacting with the user's data. This comprehensive platform offers various features to help the user explore, analyse, and manipulate the user's dataset. To get started, the user will need to upload data, and the first step in this process involves providing property information using the Property Information Form.

### Property Information Form

![Property Information Form](./img/panel-3.png)

The Property Information Form is the initial stage of data upload. It's designed to capture essential details about the property being added to the dataset. Here is a breakdown of the form fields:

1. **Step 1**: First step of data upload.

2. **Property Name**: Enter the name of the property in the `Property Name` input field.

3. **Owner Name**: The `Owner Name` field is pre-filled with the default owner name.

4. **Owner Email**: Similar to the owner name, the `Owner Email` field is pre-filled with the default owner email.

5. **Open/Close System**: Select the open or close system for the property from the dropdown menu. This choice reflects the accessibility status of the property.

6. **Property Type**: Choose the property type from the `Property Type` dropdown menu. This classification helps categorize the property.

7. **Province**: Select the province or region where the property is located from the `Province` dropdown. This information is vital for geographic referencing.

8. **Organisation**: The `Organisation` displays the name of the organisation.

9. **SAVE PROPERTY INFORMATION**: Once the user has filled in all the necessary details, they can click the `SAVE PROPERTY INFORMATION` button to store this information and proceed with the data upload process.

The map enhances the user's ability to work with spatial data and provides valuable insights into the geographical aspects of the user's records.

By completing the `Property Information Form`, the user establishes a foundational record for the property in the dataset, which is essential for effective data management and analysis.

This step ensures that the user's data is organised and ready for further processing within the data upload.

## Step 2

The second step of the data upload process on the Data upload involves working with Parcel ID and Parcel Type. This stage is crucial for adding detailed information related to parcels within the property.

### Parcel Details

![Parcel Details](./img/panel-4.png)

1. **Step 2**: Step 2 of data upload.

2. **Parcel ID**: The Parcel ID is a unique identifier for each parcel within the property.

3. **Parcel Type**: Parcel Type categorises the parcels based on their purpose or characteristics.

4. **SELECT**: The `SELECT` button allows the user to choose specific parcels from the map.

5. **DIGITISE**: Clicking the `DIGITISE` button initiates the process of mapping parcel boundaries. This step is essential for geospatial data.

6. **UPLOAD**: The `UPLOAD` is used for creating parcel boundaries using the supported formats: zip, json, geojson, gpkg, kml (CRS 4326).

7. **SAVE PROPERTY INFORMATION**: If the user needs to update or modify the property information, the user can click the `SAVE PROPERTY INFORMATION` button to make changes to the property-level information.

Completing Step 2 ensures that the user's dataset is comprehensive and includes detailed information about individual parcels within the property. This data is essential for various analyses and property management tasks.

### Select parcel using select button

![Select button](./img/panel-5.png)
