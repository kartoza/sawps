# Template upload Documentation

The data upload feature enables the user to seamlessly upload their data for analysis and integration into the system. When the user clicks on the `DATA UPLOAD` option, an upload data popup window will appear, providing the user with easy-to-use tools for uploading their data. The supported file formats for upload are CSV and XLSX.

## Uploading Data

3. **Browse Button**: Click on the `Browse` button to select the file that the user wishes to upload. A user can choose a file from the user's local storage that is in either CSV or XLSX format. This file should contain the data the user wants to integrate into the system for further analysis.

4. **Upload File Button**: After selecting the file, click on the `UPLOAD FILE` button to begin the data upload process. The system will validate and process the data, making it available for the user to use.

5. **Close Button**: If the user decides not to proceed with the upload or wishes to cancel the operation, the user can click on the `CLOSE` button. This will close the upload popup without initiating the data upload process.
