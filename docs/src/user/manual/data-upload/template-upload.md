# Template upload Documentation

The data upload feature enables the user to seamlessly upload their data for analysis and integration into the system. When the user clicks on the `DATA UPLOAD` option, an upload data popup window will appear, providing the user with easy-to-use tools for uploading their data. The supported file formats for upload are CSV and XLSX.

> DISCLAIMER: Some of the images in the manual may vary slightly from what you see on the platform due to continuous updates to the platform. On the platform you will see `green question mark` ![Help Desk Icon 1](./img/help-icon.png) buttons in the top right corner (underneath the `LOGOUT` button), you can click on these to access the help desk.

## Uploading Data

3. **Browse Button**: Click on the `Browse` button to select the file that the user wishes to upload. A user can choose a file from the user's local storage that is in either CSV or XLSX format. This file should contain the data the user wants to integrate into the system for further analysis.
