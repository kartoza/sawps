## Creating a new property by selecting parcels

There are various methods of creating a new property on the site. One of them uses a selection tool to allow you, as the user, to select the parcels you want to be a part of the property you are creating.
To create a property using this method, go to ‘Maps’ and select ‘ Data Upload’.

![Selecting Parcels 1](img/selecting-parcels-1.png)

Fill in the ‘Property Information’ form and then click on ‘Save Property Information’. Next, choose the ‘Select’ option and zoom in on the map to where your property is located.

Once you have located your property, select all of the relevant parcels. Once you are happy with your selection, click on the ‘Save Boundary’ button. If you want to deselect what you have selected, click ‘Cancel’ to clear everything and then ‘Select’ to start again or just click on the parcel again to deselect them individually.

## Enabling and disabling the basemap

Once you are in the map, you have the option of enabling and disabling ‘NGI Aerial Imagery’. This basemap allows you to visualise the map using aerial imagery. By disabling this, the map will no longer have a basemap.

## The Filters Panel

To apply filters to the data being displayed on your map, open the ‘Filters’ panel. This panel is interchangeable with the layers panel.

![Alt text](img/filters-1.png)

Here you will be able to filter by species, year and month. There are also spatial filters available in this panel. Here you can filter by population category, protected areas, activity, critical biodiversity areas and ecosystem type.

![Alt text](img/filters-2.png)

To use these filters simply check the boxes to enable them and uncheck the boxes to disable them.

![Alt text](img/filters-3.png)

The year filter works slightly differently from the rest. Simply drag the dots on the black line to choose which year(s) you want to show data for.
