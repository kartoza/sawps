# Working with the data upload

The data upload function allows users to fill in an online form or upload a CSV file to the SAWPS platform to further enrich their data.

> Note: Users must first download a template from the platform, which they populate with their own data.

## How do I upload data to a new property?

Click on the `UPLOAD DATA` button in the navigation bar. This will redirect you to an interactive map which will allow you to `CREATE A NEW PROPERTY` by clicking on 1️⃣ the button with the same name. This will redirect you to `STEP 1`.

### Step 2

In this step/tab, zoom into the location of your property on the map and then decide whether you would like to 1️⃣ [select the boundary](#select-parcel-polygons) from the existing parcel polygons, 2️⃣ [digitise your own boundary](#digitise-property), or 3️⃣ [upload a supported vector file(s)](#upload-property) of your property.

#### Select parcel polygons

Once you click on the `SELECT` button, it will change to say 1️⃣ `CANCEL`, the other two options will be greyed out and the map will highlight orange.

Once you have selected your property boundary, you can then move onto [saving Your Property](#save-property).

#### Digitise property

Once you have clicked on the `DIGITISE` button, the other two buttons will be greyed out and you will be able to select 1️⃣ the polygon tool from the tool bar that appears. If you hover your mouse over the buttons there is a popup that appears with the name of the tool.

Once it has processed the geometry, it will zoom into the bounding box of the polygon you have digitised and will also highlight any parcels that overlap your digitised boundary.

Once you have finished digitising your property boundary, you can then move onto [saving Your Property](#save-property).

Make sure you zipped your shapefiles directly, **NOT** the directory containing the shapefiles. Otherwise, the shapefiles inside the zip file will not be detected.
